This is a skeletal prototype for a possible future website for the *Digital Index of Middle English Verse* (*DIMEV*).
Anyone interested in Middle English verse should consult the official *DIMEV* website, <https://www.dimev.net/>.

The sole purpose of this site is to experiment with data structures and rendering, with a focus on the first of those.
See the [GitHub repository](http://github.com/icornelius/dimev-sandbox)

Templates employed in this website draw freely on Andrew Dunning's digital prototype of Richard Sharpe, *A Handlist of Latin Writers of Great Britain and Ireland Before 1540*.
See the [GitHub repository](http://github.com/medievallibraries/latin-writers) of that site.
