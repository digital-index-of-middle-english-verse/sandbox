This repository is a sandbox in which to prototype tools for cleanup, transformation, and validation of data curated by editors of [*DIMEV*: An Open Access, Digital Edition of the *Index of Middle English Verse*](https://www.dimev.net/).
Researchers interested in Middle English verse should consult <https://www.dimev.net/>, not this repository, as the XML source files in this repository are a snapshot and will not be updated.
They are for testing only.

The repository also hosts source files for an experimental new *DIMEV* website, build with Jekyll and hosted by GitHub Pages.
All this is very much work in progress.
Commentary is welcome.

An inspiration is Andrew Dunning's [prototype](https://github.com/medievallibraries/latin-writers) for a digital edition of Richard Sharpe, *A Handlist of Latin Writers of Great Britain and Ireland Before 1540*.
